## Purpose
- This portfolio will serve as the skeletal platform that I can use to build on moving forward as we move through the year. My hope is that as I pick up understandings of new languages and my ability to code increases, I will be able to make this website more robust and in turn it will serve as demonstration site for some of my skill as well as being an adequate way for users to get an understand of me as a person and potential colleague. 
## Functionality/Features 
- The main landing page or homepage is a simple entryway into the site. It features a navigation bar that allows the user to navigate to the about, contact, and blog pages. Along with this the homepage also features a wall of 8-bit binary code that can be translated into a welcome message for any person who may be savvy or intrigued enough to enter it into a translator. This code also features embedded links that allow for navigation through the different site pages as well. The about page features an interactive link that will take users directly to a pdf version of my resume, other than this it is comprised of information relevant to learning about me both in relation to my personality and a brief summary of my work history. The blog page has a basic set up of static elements where 5 blogs are visible in their entirety while the remaining past ten items are only listed by title and date published. I hope in the future to be able to populate these spaces with scripts that will allow the blog to update and archive itself, allowing me to actually write blog posts about the places that I travel to on the planet as I am a fanatic for travel. finally, the contact page has my email address as well as functional hyperlinks in the form of company logo's for each of the different social media platforms that anyone interested may reach out to me on in regard to future work.
