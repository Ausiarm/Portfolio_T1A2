        <p>First things first, I am a human... and indeed not the fish being held by the human. Around the age of 24 I started having daydreams about why. I couldn't stop asking myself why I was where I was, why I was doing what I was, and why any of it mattered at all. This line of reasoning led to me leaving my very perfectly situated position in the orbit of myself around normal Virginian society and out into the periphery to explore more deeply what it was that I wanted from this life. After a great deal of travel, no small amount of career considerations, and a major life-threatening surgery or two I have found myself in pursuit of Software Development. It has been a strange journey so far and all I really have to say when looking back is that there is hardly much point in trying to predict or worry too much about the outcome of our futures as it seems to become more and more apparent -- the more I live -- that we are powerless to change fates' interwoven fabric that is the tapestry of our existence.</p>

        <p>I am aspiring to become a fully fledged full stack developer by the end of the year. So far, I can work capably in both HTML5 and CSS and I dabble in Swift on the side in the hope of pursuing a deeper understanding of the language in the months to come. Beyond my immediate interest in developing I hold a bachelors degree in biology from George Mason University in America and maintain a deep love for science and its effect on human society both present and moving forward into the future. Previously I have worked in a buisness and sales role in the IT space and am passionate about helping to grow and develop successful teams that not only do work but enjoy the process of getting things done together. In my spare time I like to enjoy the wonder that is my own human body by exercising and helping others to see the benefits that come with valuing the body you are born in.
